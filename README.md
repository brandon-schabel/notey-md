## What is Notey MD?
Noty MD is a ZERO config, zero dependency, self hosted, super lightweight Markdown Notebook.

Notey MD uses only the markdown files themselves. So if you have a collection of a bunch 
of Markdown files just add it to the notes directory and you'll
be able to view and edit them in the browser. 

By default the notes directory is in the gitignore, so if you fork
the repo and want to save your markdown files to github, just remove
the notes line from the gitignore.
